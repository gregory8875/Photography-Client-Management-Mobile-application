Please place your app icon PNG here with the filename `app_icon.png`.

Expected path: assets/app_icon.png
Recommended size: a large square PNG (at least 1024x1024) with transparency if desired.

After placing the file, run:

flutter pub get
flutter pub run flutter_launcher_icons:main

This will generate platform-specific launcher icons for Android and iOS.
